# unlearn_label
We propose a novel parameter space-based Machine Unlearning framework for Multi-Label Classification using Weight Pruning to selectively remove specific training data influence, achieving 35.5Ã— speedup over retraining while maintaining >93% accuracy for retained labels and reducing forgotten attribute predictions to 0.11%.
